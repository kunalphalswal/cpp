## Everything should be balanced - Thanos

### Why Balancing matters so much?
- Imagine searching/inserting in a skewed tree. It's complexity will be O(N) instead of O(logN).

## AVL Trees
In AVL trees, the difference in height between left and right subtree cannot be more than 1. 
This doesn't make our BST PERFECTLY balanced but does a very good job in maintaining the O(logN) complexity of search/insert operations in BST.
