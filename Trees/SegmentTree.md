- The no of nodes will always be 2*n-1 but their indexing within the array might get more than 2*n-1 because there is no guarantee that the tree is a complete binary tree because at the last level, there may be nodes present on the right side but not on the left side.
hence it's advised to keep the array order of 4*n i.e. double the nodes in the tree.
